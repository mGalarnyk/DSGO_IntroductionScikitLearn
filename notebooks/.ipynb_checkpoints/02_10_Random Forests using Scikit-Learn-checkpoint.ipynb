    "Each machine learning algorithm has strengths and weaknesses. Bagged tree models use many trees to protect individual decision trees from overfitting. However, bagged tree models are not without weaknesses. Suppose you have one very strong feature in a dataset, most of the trees will use that feature as the top split. This will result in many similar trees. You can think of Random forests as a variant of a bagged tree model. The difference is that each time a split is considered, only a portion of the total number of features are split candidates. In short, Random Forests make the decision trees less correlated.  \n",
